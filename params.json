{"name":"Aurena","tagline":"Aurena distributed media player","body":"Aurena is a network distributed media playback system. It provides \r\na server for media content, and clients for synchronised playback across\r\nall receivers, similar to some (expensive) commercial systems.\r\n\r\nTo use this, just build it in the usual autoconf-ey way (configure && make)\r\n\r\nBuilding the clients requires GLib/GObject > 2.30, avahi-client and\r\navahi-glib > 0.6.24, json-glib-1.0 and libsoup >= 2.26.1, as well as\r\nGStreamer 1.0 and gst-plugins-base libs. The GUI clients also require GTK+ 3.0\r\n\r\nTo build the server binary, you additionally need sqlite >= 3.3, and\r\na slightly newer GLib (>=2.32) and libsoup (> 2.48). You only need the server\r\non one machine that will host the media files. Only a client app is needed\r\non the receivers.\r\n\r\nAfter building, run src/aurena-server on one machine, and\r\n'src/aurena-simple-client' (or one of the other client apps in src/) on\r\nseveral clients that can access the server machine 'server-host'. The clients\r\nshould auto-detect the server. If that doesn't work (if Avahi broadasts are\r\nbroken) pass the server-host name explicitly as a parameter to\r\naurena-simple-client.\r\n\r\nFor control, hit http://server-host:5457/\r\n\r\nNotes/future ideas:\r\n\r\n*) media library with metadata - see available songs\r\n*) Multiple zones, ability to move players between zones\r\n**) pause zone when 0 players online\r\n\r\n- daemon portion - http + rtsp + network clock source\r\n  + avahi announcements\r\n  + base time distribution\r\n  + http = libsoup\r\n  + network clock source = gst\r\n  - rtsp = gst-rtsp-server\r\n- player\r\n  + playbin wrapper that does rtsp or http + network clock subscription\r\n    and follows remote volume control, pause/play etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity\r\n========\r\n\r\nVery little effort has been put into making the server secure. It allows\r\nmaking clients play any arbitrary http URI. No authentication is required\r\nfor clients to connect.\r\n\r\nThis software should only ever be run on a private network, where all software\r\nrunning on the network and its clients is trusted.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
