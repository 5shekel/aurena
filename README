Hi,

To use this, just build it in the usual autoconf-ey way (configure && make)

Then, run src/sonarea on one machine, and
'src/client/simple-client' on several clients that can access the
server machine 'server-host'. If that doesn't work (if Avahi broadasts are
broken, pass the server-host name explicitly as a parameter to simple-client).
For control, hit http://server-host:5457/

Notes/future ideas:

*) media library with metadata - see available songs
*) Multiple zones, ability to move players between zones
**) pause zone when 0 players online

- daemon portion - http + rtsp + network clock source
  + avahi announcements
  + base time distribution
  + http = libsoup
  + network clock source = gst
  - rtsp = gst-rtsp-server
- player
  + playbin wrapper that does rtsp or http + network clock subscription
    and follows remote volume control, pause/play etc.
