Hi,

To use this, just build it in the usual autoconf-ey way (configure && make)

Then, run src/sonarea on one machine, and
'src/client/simple-client server-name' on several clients that can access the
server machine 'server-host'. For control, hit http://server-host:5457/

Notes/future ideas:

1) http server - see available songs
2) track song being played in each 'zone' (1 zone)
3) control song playback
4) allow players to join each song zone
5) pause zone when 0 players online
6) players subscribe to allow control of their volume settings

- daemon portion - http + rtsp + network clock source
  + avahi announcements
  + base time distribution
  + http = libsoup
  + network clock source = gst
  - rtsp = gst-rtsp-server
- need a player
  + playbin wrapper that does rtsp + network clock subscription
    and follows remote volume control
